                        Coronary angiography (CAG) is the standard imaging modality for evaluating coronary artery disease; 
                        however, its cine X-ray acquisition protocol results in substantial radiation exposure, with reported mean values of 326.9‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ107.5‚ÄØmGy for air kerma and 2341.1‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ849.9‚ÄØŒºGy¬∑m¬≤ for dose-area product. 
                        Lowering the frame rate from the conventional 15 frames per second (fps) to 7.5 or 3.8 fps has been shown to effectively reduce radiation dose‚Äîby 30% for operators and 19% for patients at 7.5 fps‚Äîyet low frame rates often degrade visual realism, limiting their adoption in clinical practice. 
                        To address this limitation, we propose a deep learning‚Äìbased video frame interpolation approach that enhances low-fps CAG videos to 15 fps equivalents. 
                        The developed algorithm was quantitatively and qualitatively validated, demonstrating high fidelity in reconstructing intermediate frames. 
                        In this study, we evaluate the clinical utility of the interpolated videos through a blinded assessment by cardiologists with varying levels of experience. 
                        Participants reviewed both interpolated and real 15 fps CAG videos to assess image quality across multiple evaluation criteria.

                        Long-term prediction of individual atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk remains a critical challenge in cardiology. 
                        Among models trained and validated using health screening data, the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) has generally demonstrated strong or state-of-the-art performance. 
                        In addition to machine learning approaches, several statistical models‚Äîsuch as <a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-calculator">PREVENT</a> and <a href="https://tools.acc.org/ascvd-risk-estimator-plus/#!/calculate/estimate/">PCE</a>‚Äîhave been applied in clinical practice. 
                        These models estimate ASCVD risk using simple equations that take a few health screening variables as input. 
                        In this study, we aim to develop a more accurate, and clinically applicable risk prediction model by leveraging the Kolmogorov‚ÄìArnold Network (KAN), 
                        which offers greater interpretability than MLP, to generate a simple and interpretable equation for ASCVD risk estimation.<br>
                        \[ 
                        f^{\text{KAN}}(\mathbf{x}) = -a  g_1(\mathrm{x}_{1}) + b   g_2(\mathrm{x_{2}}) + c.
                        \]

                        Classical machine learning struggles with right-censored data due to incomplete target values. 
                        However, since censored data indicates survival beyond a known threshold, it can still inform comparisons with uncensored data‚Äîenabling use in evaluating the concordance index (c-index), a metric for survival time ordering. 
                        This study proposes a novel method that reconstructs data into pairs, aligning with the c-index structure, and represents them as matrices for classification. 
                        Our approach directly optimizes the c-index by intuitively leveraging censored data. 
                        Evaluations on three real-world datasets show competitive performance with established survival analysis methods such as partial likelihood, rank-based approaches, and the Wasserstein metric, with no significant performance differences (t-test, p-value > 0.05). 
                        Additionally, we observe improved performance as the proportion of censored data in training increases.

                        Early detection and accurate characterization of polyps during colonoscopy or gastroscopy are essential for preventing gastrointestinal cancers, particularly colorectal cancer. 
                        Manual detection is highly dependent on the endoscopist‚Äôs experience and is subject to variability and oversight. 
                        Automated polyp detection systems can assist clinicians by improving lesion recognition rates, minimizing missed polyps, and standardizing outcomes. 
                        Furthermore, differentiating adenomatous from non-adenomatous polyps in real time enables informed clinical decisions, potentially reducing unnecessary biopsies and optimizing patient management. 
                        The integration of AI-based tools in endoscopy thus holds promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and long-term cancer prevention.
                        To this end, I have carried out several research and development projects focused on creating an AI assistant for endoscopic procedures:

                            Role: Key Contributor, I proposed the initial surrogate loss function \(L_1\) and the ranking-based loss function \(L_2\), and designed and conducted a synthetic data experiment to validate the effectiveness of the concept.

                        The \(ttHbb\) process is an essential channel to reveal the Higgs properties but has an irreducible background from the \(ttbb\) process, which produces a top quark pair in association with a b quark pair. 
                        Therefore, understanding the \(ttbb\) process is crucial for improving the sensitivity of a search for the \(ttHbb\) process. 
                        To this end, when measuring the differential cross-section of the \(ttbb\) process, we need to distinguish the b-jets originated from top quark decays, and additional b-jets originated from gluon splitting. 
                        Since there are no simple identification rules, we adopt deep learning methods to learn from data to identify the additional b-jets from the \(ttbb\) events. 
                        By exploiting the special structure of the \(ttbb\) event data, we propose several loss functions that can be minimized to directly increase matching efficiency, the accuracy of identifying additional b-jets.
